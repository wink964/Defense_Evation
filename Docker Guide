Docker:


Prerequisites

Before installing Docker Desktop:

    Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 19044+ preferred)

        Home edition works too, but only with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

    Enable WSL 2 and Virtualization in BIOS.

ðŸ§± Step-by-Step: Install Docker on Windows
1. âœ… Enable WSL 2 and Virtualization

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

wsl --install

If wsl is not recognized, follow this WSL install guide.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

Check WSL version:

wsl --list --verbose

If your distro isnâ€™t using version 2, upgrade it:

wsl --set-version <distro-name> 2

Also ensure Virtualization is enabled in BIOS (usually on by default).
2. ðŸ’¾ Download Docker Desktop

Download Docker Desktop from the official source:
ðŸ‘‰ https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
3. ðŸ§° Install Docker Desktop

    Run the installer.

    During installation, ensure these options are checked:

        Install required Windows components for WSL 2

        Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V (recommended for most setups)

    Reboot when prompted.

4. ðŸ”„ Start Docker Desktop

    Launch Docker Desktop from the Start menu.

    Wait for it to initialize â€” the whale icon will appear in the system tray.

    You might need to sign in or create a Docker Hub account, but itâ€™s optional.

5. ðŸ§ª Test Docker

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt, then test:

docker --version

Run a test container:

docker run hello-world

If you see a welcome message, Docker is running correctly.
ðŸ“¦ Optional: Pull a Linux Image

Youâ€™ll likely use Linux containers for evasion labs:

docker pull ubuntu
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash

Now youâ€™re inside an Ubuntu container, ready to mess around.
